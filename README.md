JarBundler
==========

A simple tool that uses the [appbundler](https://java.net/projects/appbundler) Ant tool to create a Mac OS X native executable (.app).

Requires Ant to be installed at /usr/share/java/ant and the above linked jar file located at /usr/share/java/ant/lib, with the name appbundler-1.0.jar. Otherwise build will be unsuccessful, even if the program says.
